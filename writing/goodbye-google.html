<h1>My Goodbye Email at Google</h1>

<p>
"What are the most important problems of your day, and why aren't you working on them?"
</p>

<p>
This question got Richard Hamming kicked out of his lunch table because it made his colleagues uncomfortable. 
</p>

<p>
We are facing the largest collective action problem humanity has ever faced. We are massively <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wcyQCYtjp8v4_KO_yE4UJHT_F9nnoobo8ftbk4buZro/edit?usp=sharing">behind schedule</a> and not even on track to fulfill our 2C Paris Agreement pledges. Why isn't everyone working on this?
</p>

<p>
I join <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6685654820591935488/">Eugene Kirpichov</a> in leaving Google to work on climate for the rest of my life. The world needs everyone who is remotely interested in this problem to do some serious self-reflection... what are the most important problems of your day, and why aren't you working on them? 
</p>

<p>
The first thing Eugene and I plan to do is create a community for like-minded people considering a leap into climate work. Our intention is to help all climate-concerned folks find meaningful and impactful roles in the climate space. We are all hands on deck at <a href="https://workonclimate.org">Work On Climate</a>!
</p>

<p>
We will be posting updates about our climate adventures to our <a href="https://climatebuddies.substack.com/">mailing list</a>.
