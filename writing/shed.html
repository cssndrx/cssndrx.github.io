<h1>Five years lost</h1>

<p>
I was stuck on a side project for 5 years. Here’s what I learned.
</p>

<p>
A few months ago on /r/DIY, I stumbled upon this post where someone spent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/czg04y/shed_is_finally_finished/">9 years making a shed</a>. It’s not even a particularly good-looking shed. 
</p>

<p>
I read the post absolutely transfixed — the shed consumed their free cycles and mind space for 9 years. That’s a very significant portion of their lifetime creative output.
</p>

<img src="../images/shed.jpg">

<p>
I was transfixed because I had my own <strong>“shed”</strong>. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>shed :=</strong> a project that has eaten a big chunk of your life, that you no longer enjoy, and won’t amount to much.
</p>

<p>
Mine is a story for teaching statistics. 
</p>


<ul class="smaller">
<li>In 2014, I worked on a story for teaching statistics as part of my master’s thesis. I graduated, but I wasn’t happy with it.</li>
<li>I spent a year after graduation unemployed and reworking the story.</li>
<li>I ran out of money, joined Google and intended to work on the story in my free time.</li>
<li>Between 2014 and 2019, I produced nine totally different versions of the story (different storylines, characters, teaching material, art). None of which I was happy with.</li>
<li>By 2019, even after spending 5 years and producing nine versions that didn’t pass my own quality bar, I still felt like I <strong>could do it</strong> — if only given more time.</li>
<li>So, I sent in a resignation to Google, planning to finish the story and find another job when I was done.</li>
<li>Thankfully, management saved me from this silly idea. They allowed me to stay on and work on the shed as a 6 month sabbatical.</li>
<li>It was only then that I realized it was a shed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is my completed shed — the <a href="http://cassandraxia.com/wizard/"><strong>Totally Not Scary Guide to Statistics</strong></a>. 
</p>


<p>
More importantly, here are my learnings from the shed project. 
</p>

<h2>1. Watch out for the shed.</h2>
<p>
<strong>The main takeaway is that there are life-consuming sheds.</strong> Watch out for projects creeping up in scope, time until they become a shed.
</p>

<p>
Shed projects seem to start out with an underestimate. You think it’s only going to take a few months, and then it drags into a year. But you acquired some new skills in the meantime, so then you think it’s really just a month more. But then it didn’t pan out the way you envisioned it, so you want to spend a few months redoing it.
</o>

<p>
Here are all the iterations I’ve spent on my shed. Each time, I thought *this* last time is going to work. 
</p>                                                                                                                                              <img src="../images/shed_screenshot.png">

<h2>2. The opposite of a shed is a cake.</h2>

<img src="../images/pies.JPG">

<p>
<strong>Cakes are time-bound.</strong> You know what you’re making, and you know roughly how long it will take. If you estimate 3 hours to make the cake, and it exceeds your estimate by a little, it’s okay. If you work on a cake for a week, the cake begins to rot. Nobody can work on a cake for 5 years. 
</p>

<p>
Because cakes are time-bound, <strong>cakes are small in scope</strong>. The small scope means that you get to quickly make a lot of iterations and see what really works. Each iteration is an experiment that provides you with valuable data on what works well. The small scope also makes it easy to follow the  advice that a prototype should test exactly one thing. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cakes have users.</strong> If you make a cake, I guarantee there will be someone excited to eat it. If you’re making a cake, you’re really making something that people want. Users offer truly objective data for when the cake is done, good, or what to change if it’s not. Make design decisions easier.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cakes are fun to make.</strong> The cake is well scoped, the end is in sight, it’s testing a new idea, and you have hope that the end user is really going to enjoy your cake. Cakes are fun! If your project has dragged on so long that it’s no longer fun, perform a shed check.
</p>

<p>
You can’t go wrong by making a cake.
</p>


<h2>But but...</h2>

<strong>Are you saying not to work on big projects?</strong>

<p>
Kind of. A big project is really a series of small projects.
</p>

<p>
When I started the shed project, I had the vision that it was going to be a grand, epic, yet intuitive, fun, and playful, useful and applicable guide to statistics. There were going to be many chapters because I had to cover all the useful concepts to daily life including expected value, variance, common distributions, Central Limit Theorem, Bayes Rule, regression, maximum likelihood, and whatever else I learned recently. As the surface area became larger, quality declined, and that was demotivating because now I was building a not-very-good thing. Changes to make the thing better meant reworking a very large surface area.
</p>

<p>
I wasn’t gathering data from the small chunks that I built out — to ensure that I was making something compelling. Somehow I deluded myself into thinking that it would all come together when it was finished, and that the whole was going to be better than the sum of the parts.
</p>


<strong>Didn’t you get anything out of it?</strong>

<p>
I learned things, but I could have made a lot of cakes and learned things as well. Mainly, I learned how to use UX design and PM principles to not make another shed.
