During my master's research project, Prof. Dor Abrahamson directed me to a book called Intuition in Science and Mathematics. The book discusses how intuition is closely tied with vision and seeing things in pictures. It suggests that things can be made more intuitive if they can be represented pictorially.

I began a quest to draw and sketch more -- while writing less.

I wrote my first Chrome extension as a means to browse Wikipedia visually -- it's called wikipics.

The extension isn't good for everything. For instance, the pictures funkify the page formatting so if you are sitting down to read the entire page, it will increase the reading time. Your eyes have to move over a bigger space.

However, the pictures are good for a number of things.

See hidden biases --  If you look at the page of Nobel Laureates there is a surprising gender bias that persists even until this day.
Make topics more approachable -- If I am unfamiliar with a topic and navigate to its Wikipedia page, sometimes I am met with a wall of text that makes me immediately press the back button. The pictures on the wikipics extension entice me to stay longer and focus on the ____. Try this page on ____
Instant flash cards -- I'm no longer a student, who has to memorize things, but wikipics acts as an instant flash card generator. See this page as an example ___. Additionally, attaching a picture to an abstract concept might make it more memorable.

For a month, I have been working on a visualization project with the Social Observatory team at the World Bank. ft

My job was to design and implement visualizations of daily well-being -- both the subject and the users were women living in rural India.

There were two main design challenge as framed by ____ of the Social Observatory, Biju Rao:

design the visualizations in such a way that they would be intuitive even to those with low literacy and numeracy.
empower the women to take action
Our preliminary ideas were to use:

affect (emotion) -- smiling faces or sad faces convey goodness and badness
color -- bright colors would be good and and grey colors would be bad
size -- larger things express dominance and smaller things are dominated
pictures to add meaning
How can we make things more interesting than the traditional histogram?

 glyphs

 

In October, I made a visit to the field [[picture]] to visit with the women. The first thing that happened was _____. My laptop trackpad had overheated.

But the women had terrific design suggestions.

 

Compromises had to be made. Many of the visualizations are not kosher by Tufte standards. The visualization on influence, for instance, uses the size of a face to denote the amount of influence ____. Tufte observes that this is confusing -- it is unclear whether width or area maps to the underlying variable.

I have always been a margin adjuster. One of those who would just as willingly write a paragraph as fiddle with the margins, fonts, and spacing to push things to length.

Two years ago, I tried to write a short story. I wanted to write a science fiction story about a dystopian future in which people wear earphones all the time. Such that it would be considered rude to take your earphones off while in public -- it would be like being naked and eavesdropping at the same time.

of the environment broadcasting instructions to opt-in participants

I wanted to show the natural progression of how broadcasting advertisements to volunteers wearing earphones as they walk down the street, once a critical mass develops... could become broadcasting mandatory information such as street signs and ___.... to the point in which the ones not wearing earphones become the weird ones, and society has added another clothing item to its mandatory ensemeble. I wanted to show how that once technology gets written into etiquette, it will take another major technological shift to remove it.

// miss manners excerpts to bridge the story

The story did not come out the way I wanted. I had the clumsy ___ tendency to heavy-handedly and pedantically belabor the point rather than swirl around the issue at hand in a thoughtful, suave manner.

Fast forward to recently. I picked up Bird by Bird, by Anne Lamott, a book on writing and life. No description of the book will do it justice. Reading the book is like having a witty, sensible, and healthily inappropriate friend named Anne with writing tips to impart.

I read the book and wrote the first voluntary, non-technical thing since the science fiction thriller that didn't work out. Anne recommends writing about your childhood because "everyone who has survived to adulthood.... [quote]"

I wrote a mood editor to help other margin adjusters start writing Anne-style: ____.

 The MIT CS department fell staunchly under the Bayesian school of statistics [[link Jacob]] so we learned about probability and machine learning as ___.

After graduation, by luck I lucked upon a book -- Statistics by Freedman. Perhaps the most gentle introduction to statistics the frequentist way (Freedman himself is a Bayesian turned frequentist!)

Frequentist notation and ideas permeate popular culture, so it is important to know what the words mean for fear of awkward fidgeting at your next cocktail party.
