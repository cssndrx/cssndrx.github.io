<h3>USA: What to do if you’re stopped by the police</h3>
-->

<p>
<strong>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
If you are a lawyer, you know when police are lying to you about your rights.
<p>

<iframe width="420" height="315"

</iframe>

<p>
But what about the rest of us? <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6406">20% of people</a> living in the US interact with the police each year. If you are stopped by the police, what should you do? 
</p>

<h3>
Problem: You cannot trust others to inform you of your rights. You simply need to know what they are. 
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4nQ_mFJV4I">“10 Rules for Dealing with Police”</a>, a short movie created by lawyers and judges associated with <a href="https://www.flexyourrights.org/">flexyourrights.org</a>. It covers your rights and what actions you can take in different contexts (answers vary depending on if you are in your car vs house, if you are being detained vs merely stopped for questioning).
</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4nQ_mFJV4I">

<p>
Here’s a recap of the movie and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KB2MKg2yp9cPJl8f0i43CJrMjjoBXrd3QwG2-kFkdAc/edit">some donuts</a> to print and leave in your glovebox.

<strong>1. Be calm and polite</strong>

<p>
Police have a tough job. They are on the lookout for any sign of danger. Make it clear that you are a sane, reasonable person. Keep your hands visible at all times. Avoid the element of surprise.
</p>

<p>
Be calm and collected. Do not raise your voice. Never touch an officer. 
</p>

<p>
If you have any weapons or potentially dangerous items on you, keep your hands visible at all times and inform the officer.
</p>

<p>
Inform the officer of your every move, if you need to reach for anything (your identification, your registration, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Say, “Good {morning, evening}. How are you officer?” Be cooperative. You may calmly assert your rights and continue to cooperate, while making sure that the police are following proper procedure.
</p>

<strong>2. Know and assert your rights</strong>

<h3>In your house</h3>
<p>
The Fourth Amendment protects you from unreasonable search and seizure in your house.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...
</p>

<p>
If an officer arrives at your house, you do not need to let them in unless they have a valid search warrant. You have a right to ask them to show you. 
</p>

<p>
Without a warrant, the officer may still ask if they can come in. If you allow them to enter, you have voluntarily waived your Fourth Amendment right. 
</p>

<p>
Instead say, “Officer, I do not give permission for you to enter my home without a warrant.” 
</p>


<h3>In your car</h3>
<p>
If you are pulled over in your car, you have less protection than when you are in your house. Police may search your car if they have <a href="https://www.flexyourrights.org/faqs/when-can-police-search-your-car/">probable cause</a>. From the link, visible contraband, the smell of marijuana (for not yet legalized states), and the admission of guilt are examples of probable cause. Minor traffic violations like speeding, broken lights, expired registration are not considered probable cause. Note that probable cause and how it is interpreted will differ in each jurisdiction.
</p>

<p>
Without probable cause, the officer may still ask if they can take a look in your car. If you say yes, you have voluntarily waived your right. Police officers are not required to inform you of your rights before asking you to consent to a search. 
</p>

<p>
If a police officer searches your car over your objection, your attorney can argue that any evidence found during the search was discovered through an illegal search and should be thrown out of court. This doctrine is called “fruit of the poisonous tree” and refers to evidence that has been obtained illegally.
</p>

<p>
Say “Officer, I know you’re just doing your job, but I don’t voluntarily consent to a search of my car.”
</p>

<h3>When you want to leave</h3>
<p>
If you have a prolonged interaction with the police and you would like to leave, say “Officer, are you detaining me or am I free to go?” 
</p>

<p>
This is a good choice of wording because an officer cannot detain you without <a href="https://waterprotectorlegal.org/rights-tips-interacting-law-enforcement/">reasonable suspicion</a>. The officer must be able to put their reasonable suspicion into words. Repeat the question calmly until you are free to go. 
</p>

<p>
If they are detaining you, they must make it clear that you are not free to go and that you are in police custody. If you are not free to go, the police must read you your Miranda Rights confirming that you have a right to remain silent; anything you say can be used against you in a court of law; you have the right to an attorney during questioning; and if you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you if you so desire.
</p>

<h3>When you don’t want to talk anymore</h3>
<p>
You may invoke the Fifth Amendment.
</p>

<p class="quote">
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
</p>

<p>
Just say, “I’m going to remain silent. I’d like to see a lawyer.”
</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>
It’s important that you’re informed for your sake as well as ours. Only by collectively knowing and asserting our rights can we prevent our country from devolving into a police state.
