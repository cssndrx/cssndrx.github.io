Thinking in pictures may help develop better knee jerk reactions. 

Visual thinking is closely related to science and math intuition. 

The visual system is massively parallel. Allowing things to be more immediate than the traditional formula/procedure ways of thought taught in schools.

Thinking in pictures also helps render concepts more concrete. Less wishy-washy.

The following is an experiment to help people think better through pictures. 

Humans are susceptible to a number of flaws in thinking. 

These include:

- Being too sure our answer is correct
- Changing our mind too much or too little in response to new information
- Identifying causality where it does not exist

[More science]
[More pictures fewer words]

The following game attempts to demonstrate probabilistic and statistical concepts visually. 


### fair bets <--> subjective probabilities

## beliefs as graphs

when making predictions we often give a number
some might give a range
but even better is to think of your belief as a graph 
this is how computers do it

This graph is a probability distribution
The possible things go on the x-axis
How likely something is gets reflected by its height


what superpower does this immediately give?

a lot of things are prefigured out for you
such as common probability distributions

for instance, the normal dist which arises naturally as the __ of a large amount of randomness summed
you can know which is more likely

other things are prefigured


PREMISE:
A game where the amount of verbal communication is limited
but you have to solve puzzles in pictures and earn words
